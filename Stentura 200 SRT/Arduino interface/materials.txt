To avoid cutting the cable, a connector can be used.

Connector name:
FFC FPC 6-pin 1.0mm 1mm Pitch Ribbon Flat Connector   cost <1€/each

Pins are not easy to solder, my experience:
- needs stand while soldering
- solder one cable front, next one back, and so on to reduce risk of soldering pins together
- fix cables with rubber once soldered to avoid easy breakouts
